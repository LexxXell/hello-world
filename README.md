# hello-world
Hello-World coding challenge


I propose to write the most "difficult" version of HelloWorld in Python.

Conditions:
1. Python 3
2. Work only in the console
3. The input variable contains the string "Hello World!". Located right after shebang and encode.
4. No imports. Only your code.

Evaluated:
1. The number of rows filled.
2. The number of functions and their consistency.
3. The degree of pythonic code.
4. Code adaptation to git.
