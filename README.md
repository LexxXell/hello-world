# hello-world
Hello-World coding challenge


I propose to write the most "difficult" version of HelloWorld in Python.

Conditions:
1. Python 3
2. Work only in the console
3. The input variable contains the string "Hello World!". Located right after shebang and encode.
4. No imports. Only your code.
5. Only one "print()" in whole code.
6. Most abstract code.

Evaluated:
1. The number of rows filled.
2. The number of functions and their consistency.
3. The degree of pythonic code.
4. Code adaptation to git.
